## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Fusion research credentials
- Facility access permissions
- Data analysis capability
- Simulation software
- Secure communication infrastructure

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fusion-platform.git

# Install dependencies
cd fusion-platform
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Set environment variables in `.env`:
    - `RESEARCH_API_KEY`: Research access
    - `FACILITY_KEY`: Equipment access
    - `DATA_SHARING_KEY`: Data exchange
    - `VERIFICATION_KEY`: Result validation

2. Configure system parameters in `config.js`:
    - Experiment parameters
    - Safety thresholds
    - Resource priorities
    - Verification criteria

## Usage

### Experiment Management
```javascript
// Example of creating experiment design
await experimentDesign.createExperiment(
    parameters,
    objectives,
    requirements,
    timeline
);
```

### Data Management
```javascript
// Example of sharing research data
await dataSharing.publishData(
    experimentId,
    results,
    metadata,
    accessRights
);
```

### Resource Coordination
```javascript
// Example of requesting facility access
await resourceAllocation.requestResource(
    facilityId,
    requirements,
    duration,
    priority
);
```

### Breakthrough Management
```javascript
// Example of submitting breakthrough claim
await breakthroughVerification.submitClaim(
    discovery,
    evidence,
    methodology,
    implications
);
```
